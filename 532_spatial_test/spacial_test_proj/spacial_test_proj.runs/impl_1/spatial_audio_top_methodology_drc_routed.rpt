2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-16#1 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM fir_right/audio_history_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio and clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_audio]
Related violations: <none>
